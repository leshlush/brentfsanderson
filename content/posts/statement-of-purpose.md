I've started a new personal website, as of December 1, 2025, as a place for me to post publicly some of my thoughts and writings. I will write about whatever strikes me, though common themes are likely to include:

- Education
- Technology
- Arts and Literature

As a natural procrastinator, I am also publicly setting a deadline for myself that the first substantial piece of writing will appear here by Monday, December 8, 2025.
