# Background
I have worked as a software engineer, a high school computer science teacher, a curriculum manager, and the founder of an education technology startup ( https://www.encodecreate.com ). I have over a decade of experience at the intersection of computer science and education

# Purpose
As someone whose job involves teaching young people about technology, I am increasingly concerned by the way technology seems to do harm to those who use it.

My aim is to discuss a more humane way to use or technology, with a focus on the world of education. I will also discuss books, the arts, and the possibility of Christian humanism.
# Services

I work with education technology companies to help them bring products to market and integrate with existing edtech standards.

I talk to churches and Christian schools about how to understand and wrestle with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and large language models.

My company empowers organizations to better teach computer science.
