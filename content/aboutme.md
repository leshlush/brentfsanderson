![](static/images/headShotLinkedIn.jpg)

I have worked as a software engineer, a high school computer science teacher, a curriculum manager, and the founder of an education technology startup. I have over a decade of experience at the intersection of computer science and education

I'm going to use this website to write about anything I feel like writing about, which may include edtech, teaching computer science, humane ways to use technology, and arts and literature.

I live in Nashville, TN. My wife Rachel and I have three daughters and one son.
