![](static/images/headShotLinkedIn.jpg)

I have worked as a software engineer, a high school computer science teacher, a curriculum manager, and the founder of an education technology startup ( https://www.encodecreate.com ). I have over a decade of experience at the intersection of computer science and education

As someone whose job involves teaching young people about technology, I am increasingly concerned by the way technology seems to do harm to those who use it.

I write about humane ways to interact with technology, with a focus on the world of education. I also discuss books, the arts, and the possibility of Christian humanism.
