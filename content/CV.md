# Summary
As a former startup founder, software developer, curriculum manager, and high school teacher, I've built a career at the intersection of education, technology, and product development. I specialize in translating classroom needs into engaging instructional materials and learning tools.

**I'm highly skilled at** building engaging and innovative STEM curriculum, navigating K-12 technical standards and LMS integrations, and shipping quality products on time.

**I'm passionate about** coding and computer science, teaching other people how to build things, and solving problems in education.
